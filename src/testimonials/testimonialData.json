            "quote": "Have worked with Nik on quite a few projects now, both framing remodels and tying into existing roof line conditions. As well as removing walls and installation of structural beam work. He and his crew are exceptional at setting trusses and conventional framing. He can be trusted to perform and stick to schedules. He is on time, efficient and has a great attitude to work with. I have been using Him and recommending him for some time now for framing and deck projects especially in the Northern Salt Lake county Logan area. From reviewing plan take offs to finish carpentry. Decks to Doors He is a excellent craftsman and a very capable contractor. I highly recommend him for your construction projects. You can't go wrong calling Lee Carpentry"
